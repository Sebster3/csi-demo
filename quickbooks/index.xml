In QuickBooks, a job record serves as a way to track income and expenses for a specific project or job. It allows us to assign different transactions, such as invoices, bills, and payments, to a specific job and then view the profitability of that job in reports. By using job records, we can easily see which jobs are the most profitable, which jobs are over budget, and which clients owe money, among other insights.</description>
